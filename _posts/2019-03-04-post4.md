This is a fractal made in the first few weeks of classes in Fall 2018. 

It was made by successively drawing smaller and smaller triangles which bisect line segements of the perimeter. The preliminary triangles were in pencil, then the outline was traced in pen, and the pencil erased. Bidding for this piece starts at $0.01.
