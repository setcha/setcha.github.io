Finished in December 2018, this piece was made by freehand drawing numerous circles nested within one another.

A preliminary circle was drawn, then the two largest circles that could fit within the largest circle was drawn. From there, the largest circle that could be fit in the drawing without crossing any other circle was drawn. The final step was coloring in parallel lines, 1/32" apart, across all of the circles. The bidding for this piece begins at $0.25.
