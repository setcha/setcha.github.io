<h1>About the Site</h1>

Each of these drawings was made in class by The Doodler. Drawing allows The Doodler to stay awake in class, since he doesnt drink caffeine. The Doodler has found that he likes drawing fractal-like patterns, and then very precisely coloring them all in. Each of the pieces found on this site were drawn free-hand (not counting the graph paper).
